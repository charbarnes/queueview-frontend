This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## View Deployments

To view the deployed app, go to the [QueueView public domain](https://queueview.vercel.app). It has been configured so that whenever a change has been pushed to the `main` branch of this github repository, the CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys these changes to production using Vercel.
